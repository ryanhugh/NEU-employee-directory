# NEU-employee-directory [![Travis CI Builds](https://travis-ci.org/ryanhugh/NEU-employee-directory.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ryanhugh/NEU-employee-directory/)
Search through Northeastern Professor and Employee data!

Old project that was a search box just like https://searchneu.com but it just searched over employees. This data source/scrapers have been incorporated into the search neu codebase!

The scrapers ran on Travis CI once a week and automatically updated the data. When the Travis badge above was green, the data was at most 1 week old. :)

UI borrowed from [Two Factor Authenticaton](https://github.com/2factorauth/twofactorauth)
